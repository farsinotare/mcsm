## Install

The project is based on the hexo static site generator, see [http://hexo.io](http://hexo.io ) based on [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/).

To get going, you must [install Node.js first](http://nodejs.org/download/). Node has a great package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which is needed to install hexo.

Then:

      $ npm install -g hexo
      $ cd mcsm
      $ npm install

You can develop on the site with:

     $ hexo server

With:

     $ hexo generate

You get a set of static files in /public
